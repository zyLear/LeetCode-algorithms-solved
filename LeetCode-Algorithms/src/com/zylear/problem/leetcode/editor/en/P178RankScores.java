//Table: Scores 
//
// 
//+-------------+---------+
//| Column Name | Type    |
//+-------------+---------+
//| id          | int     |
//| score       | decimal |
//+-------------+---------+
//id is the primary key for this table.
//Each row of this table contains the score of a game. Score is a floating 
//point value with two decimal places.
// 
//
// 
//
// Write an SQL query to rank the scores. The ranking should be calculated 
//according to the following rules: 
//
// 
// The scores should be ranked from the highest to the lowest. 
// If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. 
// After a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer 
//value. In other words, there should be no holes between ranks. 
// 
//
// Return the result table ordered by score in descending order. 
//
// The query result format is in the following example. 
//
// 
// Example 1: 
//
// 
//Input: 
//Scores table:
//+----+-------+
//| id | score |
//+----+-------+
//| 1  | 3.50  |
//| 2  | 3.65  |
//| 3  | 4.00  |
//| 4  | 3.85  |
//| 5  | 4.00  |
//| 6  | 3.65  |
//+----+-------+
//Output: 
//+-------+------+
//| score | rank |
//+-------+------+
//| 4.00  | 1    |
//| 4.00  | 1    |
//| 3.85  | 2    |
//| 3.65  | 3    |
//| 3.65  | 3    |
//| 3.50  | 4    |
//+-------+------+
