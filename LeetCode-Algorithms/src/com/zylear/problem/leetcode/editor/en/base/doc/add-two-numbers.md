#### Approach 1: Elementary Math

**Intuition**

Keep track of the carry using a variable and simulate digits-by-digits sum starting from the head of list, which contains the least-significant digit.

![Illustration of Adding two numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems//Figures/2_add_two_numbers.svg)


*Figure 1. Visualization of the addition of two numbers: *342 + 465 = 807*.  
Each node contains a single digit and the digits are stored in reverse order.*


**Algorithm**

Just like how you would sum two numbers on a piece of paper, we begin by summing the least-significant digits, which is the head of *l1* and *l2*. Since each digit is in the range of ![0\ldots9 ](./p__0_ldots_9_.png) , summing two digits may "overflow". For example *5 + 7 = 12*. In this case, we set the current digit to *2* and bring over the *carry = 1* to the next iteration. *carry* must be either *0* or *1* because the largest possible sum of two digits (including the carry) is *9 + 9 + 1 = 19*.

The pseudocode is as following:

* Initialize current node to dummy head of the returning list.
* Initialize carry to *0*.
* Initialize *p* and *q* to head of *l1* and *l2* respectively.
* Loop through lists *l1* and *l2* until you reach both ends.
    * Set *x* to node *p*'s value. If *p* has reached the end of *l1*, set to *0*.
    * Set *y* to node *q*'s value. If *q* has reached the end of *l2*, set to *0*.
    * Set *sum = x + y + carry*.
    * Update *carry = sum / 10*.
    * Create a new node with the digit value of ![(sum\bmod10) ](./p___sum_bmod_10__.png)  and set it to current node's next, then advance current node to next.
    * Advance both *p* and *q*.
* Check if *carry = 1*, if so append a new node with digit *1* to the returning list.
* Return dummy head's next node.

Note that we use a dummy head to simplify the code. Without a dummy head, you would have to write extra conditional statements to initialize the head's value.

Take extra caution of the following cases:

| Test case | Explanation |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| *l1=[0,1]*<br>*l2=[0,1,2]* | When one list is longer than the other. |
| *l1=[]*<br>*l2=[0,1]* | When one list is null, which means an empty list. |
| *l1=[9,9]*<br>*l2=[1]* | The sum could have an extra carry of one at the end, which is easy to forget. |

```
public ListNode addTwoNumbers(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
    ListNode dummyHead = new ListNode(0);
    ListNode p = l1, q = l2, curr = dummyHead;
    int carry = 0;
    while (p != null || q != null) {
        int x = (p != null) ? p.val : 0;
        int y = (q != null) ? q.val : 0;
        int sum = carry + x + y;
        carry = sum / 10;
        curr.next = new ListNode(sum % 10);
        curr = curr.next;
        if (p != null) p = p.next;
        if (q != null) q = q.next;
    }
    if (carry > 0) {
        curr.next = new ListNode(carry);
    }
    return dummyHead.next;
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : ![O(\max(m,n)) ](./p__O_max_m,_n___.png) . Assume that *m* and *n* represents the length of *l1* and *l2* respectively, the algorithm above iterates at most ![\max(m,n) ](./p__max_m,_n__.png)  times.

* Space complexity : ![O(\max(m,n)) ](./p__O_max_m,_n___.png) . The length of the new list is at most ![\max(m,n)+1 ](./p__max_m,n__+_1_.png) .

**Follow up**

What if the the digits in the linked list are stored in non-reversed order? For example:

![(3\to4\to2)+(4\to6\to5)=8\to0\to7 ](./p____3_to_4_to_2__+__4_to_6_to_5__=_8_to_0_to_7__.png)
